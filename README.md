# Crowd_Counting

This is my final team project for the 'Introduction to Deep Learning' class at the University of Toronto, where I was an exchange student during the winter semester of 2024 (January to April).

## 1) Introduction

In this project, we aim to design and implement a crowd counting model using deep learning techniques. Our goal is to develop a robust and accurate model capable of accurately estimating crowd densities in images and videos in real-time as shown in the image below. In addition to its practical applications in security, urban planning, and event management, accurate crowd counting is essential to understanding crowd behavior and facilitating crowd control measures during emergencies, making it a crucial tool for public safety. We will leverage encoder and decoder concepts, skip connections, other advanced architectures (inlcuding investigating pretrained models), and optimization techniques to further enhance the performance and efficiency of our model.
