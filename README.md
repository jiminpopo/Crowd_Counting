# Crowd_Counting

This is my final team project for the 'Introduction to Deep Learning' class at the University of Toronto, where I was an exchange student during the winter semester of 2024 (January to April).
Here is my final report. Due to file size limitations, the final report will be uploaded in two parts.


The order of the report is as follows:

## part 1
### 1) Introduction
### 2) Data Loading and Preprocessing
### 3) Data Visualization

## part 2
### 4) Model and result
### 5) Quantitative Results
### 6) Qualitative Results

## part 3
### 7) Testing on new data and demonstration
### 8) Related Works
### 9) conclusion
